The objective of this project is to test the fellows working knowledge of Git in conjunction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You will be provided a template, with a given number of tasks to be completed within their alotted assessment time. Take your time to familiarize yoursef with the template code. Much can be reused to arrive to your solutions. Ask questions if anything is unclear.

## Tasks

1. ✔ In ``main.js``, add more categories to the ``CATEGORY`` array, including:
    - Beef
    - Chicken
    - Lamb
    - Pasta
    - Pork
    - Seafood
    - Vegetarian
    - Vegan
    - Side
    - Dessert
2. ✔ Test that each category works accordingly
3. ✔ In ``main.js``, each item should have a header and an accompanying image, both if which are accessible through the ``data`` variable's properties in the fetch request
    1. ✔ Add a ``header`` to the container
    2. ✔ Add an ``image`` to the container UNDER the header
       - ✔ Style the image with appropriate dimensions so that it is not stretching or warping
    4. ✔ For both, use the JavaScript method ``appendChild``
4. ✔ In ``style.css``, each element in the ``mealContainer`` class should be centered.

## How You Will Be Graded

Your assessment will be considered graded and passing when each of the following is done:

1. Your code is bug-free. The console should not return any errors and executing your project should create a positive user experience
2. Each ``category`` appropriately retrieves the ``data`` from its API (already provided)
3. Each meal is styled, centered, and neat. Ensure it is easy to read and the images are scaled at an appropriate size and resolution
